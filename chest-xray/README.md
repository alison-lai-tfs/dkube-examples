# Chest X-Ray Example
Alison's fork change

This example trains a model to identify pneumonia from chest x-rays.

## Example Flow

- Create the necessary DKube resources
- Launch a JupyterLab notebook to experiment with your code
- Compare the model metrics
- Deploy a model for serving
- Train a model with hyperparameter optimization

If you want to create a Model Monitor, you can follow the steps at [Create a Model Monitor](./README-monitor-nb.md).

> **Note** If you want to use the `Fast Setup` script, go to the file [README-fast-setup](./README-fast-setup.ipynb)

  - **Repos Tab**
    - **Inputs / Datasets:** *`<your-dataset-repo>`*   **(Chosen during Dataset repo creation)**
      - **Mount Path:** `/data`
    - **Outputs / Models:** *`<your-model-repo>`*   **(Chosen during Model repo creation)**
      - **Mount Path:** `/model`
    > **Note** Ensure that you select the `Output Models` section, and not the `Input`
- Leave the rest of the fields at their current value
- `Submit`

## 5. Clone a Run and Train a 2nd Model

- Select `Runs` menu on the left
- Select *`<your-run-name>`*
  > **Note** There may be other Runs, but choose the one that you created
- Select `Clone` from the top menu
- Fill in the following fields:
  - **Basic Tab**
    - **Name:** `Choose a new name`
    - Leave the rest of the Basic fields at their current value<br><br>
  - **Configuration Tab**
    - Select `Environment variables` by choosing the `+` button on the right
      - **Key:** `EPOCHS`  **(Must be in all caps)**
      - **Value:** `10`

- Select the `lineage` tab
- This shows the inputs and outputs of the Run that created this Model

## 7. Deploy a Model

  - Select `Raw`
  - Right-click on the file and use `Save as...` <br><br>
- Select the `Runs` menu on the left
- Choose the first Run
- Select the Run checkbox and `Clone` on the top menu screen menu
  - **Name:** `Choose a name`
  - Select the `Configuration` tab
  - Delete any `Environmental variables` using the `X` on the right
  > **Note** This step is important, since the Katib run will not work properly with variables active
  - Select the `Upload` button on the `Upload Tuning Definition` section
  - Choose the Katib file that you downloaded
- `Submit` <br><br>
- When the Run is complete, a single Model will be created with the best trial
- You can view the results by selecting the Katib icon on the far right of the Run

## 9. Create Resources for Pipeline and Monitor

This section sets up the resources and global variable definitions to enable a Pipeline Run and Model Monitor.

- Within the `JupyterLab` tab, open `resources.ipynb`
- Change the following variables in the 3rd cell `User-Defined Variables`
  - DKUBE_TRAINING_CODE_NAME = `<your-code-repo>`
  - TRAINING_DATASET = `<your-dataset-repo>`
  - DKUBE_MODEL_NAME = `<your-model-name>`
  - Leave the other variables at their current value
- `Run All Cells`

## 10. Run a Kubeflow Pipeline

This section executes a Pipeline to train and deploy a model.

- Within the `JupyterLab` tab, open `train-and-deploy.ipynb`
- `Run all Cells` <br><br>
- Select `Pipelines` on the left menu
- Select `Runs` tab on the top

You will see your Pipeline listed as being executed.  When the Pipeline is complete, both steps will have a green checkmark.

- Select the `Deployments` menu on the left
- Your new Deployment will appear, with the name `<your-user-name>-chest-xray`

> **Note** You can create a Model Monitor by following the steps at [Create a Model Monitor](./README-monitor-nb.md)
